---

### 3. Build OpenRoad

```
./build_openroad.sh --local
```
This step compiles (builds) all the tools from that source code so you can actually use them.
What Gets Built:

* OpenROAD - The main tool that does floorplan, placement, routing, etc.
* Yosys - The synthesis tool (converts Verilog to gates) - you've used this before!
* Other utilities - ABC, KLayout, Magic, etc.

---

Ôªø**The openroad file exists and is 97MB**

 ---

### 5. Run openroad flow
```
make
```
* Runs the full RTL-to-GDSII flow on the "gcd" test design
* Synthesis ‚û°Ô∏è Floorplan ‚û°Ô∏è Placement ‚û°Ô∏è Clock Tree Synthesis ‚û°Ô∏è Routing

---

### 6. View the complete design
   
* Opens the OpenROAD GUI
* Shows the complete routed chip with all wires connected
```
make gui_final
```
---

---
* Chip layout with coloured metal layers
* Stnadard cells arranged in rows


We've just verified the full flow works. Now we need to run ONLY the floorplan and placement stages


### 7. Run Synthesis (Required Before Floorplan)

Before floorplan, we need synthesis (converts Verilog to gates):
```
make synth
```

* **Input**: RTL Verilog code.
* **Output**: A gate-level netlist, which is the required input for the floorplan stage.

---

### 8. Run Floorplan 
```
make floorplan
```
What this does:
* üó∫Ô∏è **Creates the chip boundary** (die area) and the core area for placing standard cells.
* üìç **Places the I/O pins** around the periphery of the core.
* üìè **Defines the standard cell rows** where the logic gates will be placed.
* ‚ö° **Builds the Power Delivery Network (PDN)** to supply power to all parts of the chip.

---

### 9. View the Floorplan in GUI

Now let's visualize what the floorplan created:
```
make gui_floorplan
```
What this does:
* Opens the GUI showing ONLY the floorplan stage
* You'll see:

* The outer **die boundary** and the inner **core area**.
* Empty blue horizontal lines, which are the **standard cell rows**.
* A grid of pink/purple lines, which is the **power grid**.
* **I/O pins** placed around the edges.
---

---
What's Visible:

* **Pink/purple horizontal bars** - Power delivery network (PDN) stripes
* **Blue horizontal lines** - Standard cell rows (empty, waiting for cells)
* **Die boundary** - The outer rectangle defining chip size
* **Core area** - The inner area where cells will be placed
* **Metal layers** shown in the left panel (metal1-10, via layers)

> **Key Observation:** At this stage, the rows are empty. No standard cells have been placed yet. This is the correct output for the floorplan stage.

### 10. Run Placement 
```
make place
```

What this does:

* **Global placement** - Roughly positions all cells
* **Detailed placement** - Fine-tunes cell positions to legal locations
* Optimizes for timing and wirelength
---

---

ÔªøKey results from the screenshot:
* Detailed placement completed - "report_design_area" section shows final metrics
* Design area: 668 um¬≤ with 58% utilization
* **No violations** - "Found 0 placement violations and 0 padding violations"
* **Timing improvements** - HPWL (Half-Perimeter Wire Length) optimized through multiple passes
* Cell flipping performed for better routing compatibility

### 11. View the Placement in GUI

Now let's see the cells actually placed:
```
make gui_place
```

What this does:
* Opens GUI showing the placement stage
* You'll see:

  * All the floorplan infrastructure (rows, power grid)
  * PLUS actual standard cells placed in the rows
  * Cells arranged optimally for timing and routing
---
<img width="1373" height="1067" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-24 at 10 57 09‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30337367-eb5b-4caf-bcf8-4eedda92d00c" />

---

**Comparison - Floorplan vs Placement:**

* Before (Floorplan): Empty blue rows waiting for cells
* After (Placement): Rows now FILLED with colorful standard cells

What you're seeing:
* **Blue/colored rectangles** - Individual standard cells (gates) now placed
* **Pink horizontal stripes** - Power delivery network (same as before)
* **Dense cell packing** - Cells optimally arranged in rows
* **Yellow vertical line** - Channel separator in the middle
* **I/O pins** - Small markers on edges (top and sides)
* **This shows the 58% utilization** - cells occupy about 60% of the available core area.

* **HPWL Improvement**: -10.9% (wire length was successfully reduced during optimization).
* **Design Area**: 668 ¬µm¬≤ with **58% utilization**.

**Placement Validation (All Passed ‚úì):**

* ‚úÖ **0 overlapping cells**
* ‚úÖ **0 spacing violations**
* ‚úÖ **0 row alignment problems**
* ‚úÖ **0 site alignment problems**

**Optimization Steps Performed:**

* **Global Swaps**: Achieved a 4.04% improvement in wirelength.
